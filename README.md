# Responsive Zoom

## Draft

A javascript plugin that adds an ability to enlarge text/paragraph inside an HTML document without screwing the zoom of an entire page.

For me it will be mostly useful for smartphones and tablets, since I always have troubles reading text that is tiny on my phone and tablet. Ideally, I like to zoom in a text without changing the page layout but it is rarely possible.
